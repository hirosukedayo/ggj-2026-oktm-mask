    /* Keyframes for gradients are tricky in standard CSS without Houdini or lots of steps. 
       However, browers often don't animate gradients smoothly between two keyframes if declared fully like this.
       
       Better approach: Use a CSS variable or a massive pseudo-element scale.
       Let's try the scaling masked element approach or just use clip-path if we accept a hard edge (or slight SVG blur).
       
       Actually, a simple way for smooth gradient animation is masking.
       Let's use a black div and mask it with a radial gradient that expands.

}

/* Re-thinking for smooth animation:
   Use a black container.
   Use a mask-image that is an ellipse.
   Animate the mask-size or a custom property.
   
   Actually, easiest pure CSS for "opening visuals" is often:
   Div with wide borders? No.
   
   Let's stick to the CLIP-PATH approach but INVERTED.
   We want to show the underlying game through the hole.
   So we need an overlay that HAS a hole.
   
   SVG Mask is best for this.
   Or... `box-shadow` with huge spread.
