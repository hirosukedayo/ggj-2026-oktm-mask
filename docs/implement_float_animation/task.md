# Implement Floating Animation for Result Photos

- [ ] Define `@keyframes floatComplex1` and `@keyframes floatComplex2` with both X and Y translations.
- [ ] Apply `floatComplex1` to odd cards and `floatComplex2` to even cards.
- [ ] Use prime number durations (e.g., 7s, 11s) to minimize synchronization.
- [ ] Ensure the animation loops infinitely.
