# Spot Logic Reorganization Task

- [x] Update `utils/locales.ts` to include text placeholders for new incident scenarios and combinations.
- [x] Refactor `app/game/page.tsx`:
    - [x] Update `checkSpotCollision` (if needed, or verify it works with new constants).

        - [x] Both Answer A & B -> Ending.
        - [x] Incident combination or single Incident -> Unique Scenario.
        - [x] Single Answer or No Spot -> Random Failure Scenario.
    - [x] Update `prepareResult` to use `determineScenario`.
    - [x] Clean up unused logic/constants if any.
